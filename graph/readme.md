# graph

- Data structure that consists of a finite set of vertices (also called nodes) and a set of edges connecting these vertices. Some of the main characteristics of a graph are:

  - Vertices: The vertices in a graph represent the objects or entities being modeled. For example, in a graph of a social network, the vertices could represent people and the edges could represent the connections between them.

  - Edges: The edges in a graph represent the relationships or connections between the vertices. In a directed graph, the edges have a direction and are called arcs. In an undirected graph, the edges do not have a direction and are called edges.

  - Weight: Some edges in a graph may have a weight or cost associated with them, which can represent the strength of the connection or the cost of traveling along the edge.

  - Adjacency: Two vertices in a graph are said to be adjacent if they are connected by an edge.

  - Path: A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices connected by edges. The length of a path is the number of edges in the path.

  - Cycle: A cycle in a graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex and contains at least one edge. A graph that has no cycles is called a tree.

  - Connectedness: A graph is said to be connected if there is a path between any two vertices. A graph that is not connected is called a disconnected graph.

  - Degree: The degree of a vertex in a graph is the number of edges incident to it. In an undirected graph, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges connecting it, while in a directed graph, the degree of a vertex is the number of incoming edges (in-degree) and the number of outgoing edges (out-degree).

  - Subgraph: A subgraph of a graph is a subset of the vertices and edges of the original graph.

  - Isomorphism: Two graphs are said to be isomorphic if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices and edges that preserves the structure of the graph.
