# tree

- A tree is a data structure that consists of nodes organized into a hierarchy
- Hierarchy: A tree has a hierarchical structure, with a root node at the top and child nodes below it. Each child node can have its own children, creating a branching structure.
- Parent-child relationships: Each node in a tree has a parent node, except for the root node, which has no parent. Each node can also have one or more child nodes.
- Leaf nodes: Leaf nodes are nodes that have no children. They are found at the bottom of the tree.
- Depth: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root node to that node. The depth of the root node is 0, and the depth of its children is 1, and so on.
- Height: The height of a tree is the maximum depth of any node in the tree.
- Binary trees: A binary tree is a special type of tree in which each node has at most two children.
- Relies on recursivity for most of it's operations (search, traverse, etc)
